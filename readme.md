# Blog App


## Creating a simple blog app involves designing and developing a software application that allows users to create and publish blog posts. The app should have a user-friendly interface that enables users to easily compose and format their blog posts, add images or other media, and publish them to a website.

## In addition to creating blog posts, the app should also allow readers to leave comments on the posts. These comments should be stored in a database and displayed alongside the blog post for other readers to see.
